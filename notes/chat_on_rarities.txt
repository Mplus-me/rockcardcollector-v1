Got it — you want **pack names that sound straightforward and progression-based**, without overlapping the card rarity labels like *Common / Uncommon / Rare / Epic / Legendary*.

You’re after something that feels like **realistic tiers of booster packs** — clean, readable, and easy for players to instantly understand the hierarchy.

Here’s a refined list of **20 pack names**, grouped into **5 clear tiers**, starting with simple and familiar, then moving up to premium and exclusive — all while keeping a grounded, believable tone.

These names stay clean, professional, and progression-friendly — perfect for a fantasy game that wants structure without sounding over-the-top or confusing.

Would you like me to **narrow this down to a clean set of 5–7 core packs** (e.g., the actual ones you’d use in-game), or **keep the full range** for flavor or seasonal expansions?
